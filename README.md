# Bus Tracking Exercise

Do you ever wonder how to show the route from a point to another? especially when you building up your own website? without asking help from google map? 
Why not run the index.html in your browser and click-on 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard' to find out the bus route between MIT campus and Harvard 
if you want to find out more do check the on the .Js file to have the idea to build your own 'route' 

 
Lastly, I will update this 'app' to be a live tracker once it ready
